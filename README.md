#Battleships Web

An online guessing game for for two players which dates from World War I. It was published by various companies as a pad-and-pencil game in the 1930s, and was released as a plastic board game by Milton Bradley in 1967. Battleship was one of the earliest games to be produced as a computer game, with a version being released for the Z80 Compucolor in 1979. The 2012 film Battleship is an American science fiction action movie inspired by the board game.

The game is played on two grids, one for each player. The grids are square – 10×10 – and the individual squares in the grid are identified by letter and number. 

Before play begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their grid. Each ship occupies a number of consecutive squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically. The number of squares for each ship is determined by the type of the ship. The ships cannot overlap (i.e., only one ship can occupy any given square in the grid). The types and numbers of ships allowed are the same for each player. These may vary depending on the rules.

After the ships have been positioned, the game proceeds in a series of rounds. In each round, each player takes a turns to select a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at. If the square is occupied by a ship, it is a "hit", this is marked on their grid and taken out of play to build up a picture of the opponent's fleet.

When all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship is sunk, and the ship's owner announces "You sank my battleship!". If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and their opponent wins.
